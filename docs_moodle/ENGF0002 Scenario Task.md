Team 2(Member): 

Yadong(Adam) Liu, Robbie (Peisen) Lin, Huijie Yan, Xinrui Yang

* The whole Scenario is to create a logic or math exercise practice tool.
Link to module: https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=22924&section=10

## Scenario 1

Describe your proposed tool and some detail of implementation.

* Decide on a plan in groups.
* Practice written communication skills.

## Scenario 2

Implement (a prototype of) your tool and demo it.
* Practice programming skills, verbal communication skills.

* Aim for low amount of work (2-5 hours per person per week).

## About the scenario

Designing a logic/math exercise

* Draw upon concepts and skills that were/are required for your classes:
	* COMP0147 (Discrete Math), COMP0003 (Logic and automata), COMP0005 (Algorithms), COMP0012 (Compilers), ENGF0001 (Challenges), ENGF0002 (T1 - DAPS)

* Example topics:
	- Logic gates, propositional logic, truth table, inference, etc.
	- Sets, functions, relations,
	- Combinatorics,
	- Linear algebra,
	- Algorithms, complexity analysis, etc.

### Example ideas

1. Truth table filler
2. Binary relation visualizer
3. Regular expression tool

## Marking

### Scenario 1 marking

* Deliverable: 5-8 page proposal of your tool.
* Deadline: Friday 12 February, 4:00PM
* All members of group get the same mark.
* Worth half of scenarios mark / 20% of ENGF0002 mark.
* See coursework brief for mor details.
